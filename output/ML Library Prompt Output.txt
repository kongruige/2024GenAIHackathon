Source: Renewable energy data book, NREL
Stefano Ermon Machine Learning 1: Linear Regression March 31, 2016 3 / 25Challenges for the grid
Wind and solar are intermittent
We will need traditional power plants when the wind stops
Many power plants (e.g., nuclear) cannot be easily turned on/oﬀ or
quickly ramped up/down
With more accurate forecasts, wind and solar power become more
eﬃcient alternatives
A few years ago, Xcel Energy (Colorado) ran ads opposing a proposal
that it use 10% of renewable sources
Thanks to wind forecasting (ML) algorithms developed at NCAR, they
now aim for 30 percent. Accurate forecasting saved the utility $6-$10
million per year
Stefano Ermon Machine Learning 1: Linear Regression March 31, 2016 4 / 25Motivation
Solar and wind are intermittent
Can we accurately forecast how much energy will we consume
tomorrow?
Diﬃcult to estimate from “a priori” models
But, we have lots of data from which to build a model

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Coder (to chat_manager):

It appears there might be an issue with the directory structure or the Python path. To resolve this, we can adjust the structure of the package and include the necessary files.

1. Make sure you have the following directory structure:
```
- main_directory/
    - linear_regression_package/
        - __init__.py
        - model_training.py
        - prediction.py
        - evaluation.py
    - main_script.py
```

2. Update the `__init__.py` file:
```python
# linear_regression_package/__init__.py

from linear_regression_package.model_training import train_linear_regression_model
from linear_regression_package.prediction import predict_linear_regression
from linear_regression_package.evaluation import evaluate_linear_regression_model
```

3. Execute the main script (`main_script.py`) to use the package functions.

By ensuring the directory structure and file contents are correctly set up, you should be able to import and use the functions from the package successfully. After making these adjustments, please run the code again to verify the functionality of the package.

It seems there was an error in the execution environment. Let's simplify the implementation and structure for better compatibility:

Structure your files as follows:

1. Create a directory named `linear_regression_package`.
2. Inside the `linear_regression_package` directory, create the following files:

- `__init__.py`
- `model_training.py`
- `prediction.py`
- `evaluation.py`

Here is the updated content for each file:

```python
# linear_regression_package/__init__.py

from .model_training import train_linear_regression_model
from .prediction import predict_linear_regression
from .evaluation import evaluate_linear_regression_model
```

```python
# linear_regression_package/model_training.py

import numpy as np

def train_linear_regression_model(features, target):
    coefficients = np.linalg.inv(features.T.dot(features)).dot(features.T).dot(target)
    return coefficients
```

```python
# linear_regression_package/prediction.py

import numpy as np

def predict_linear_regression(features, coefficients):
    predictions = features.dot(coefficients)
    return predictions
```

```python
# linear_regression_package/evaluation.py

import numpy as np

def evaluate_linear_regression_model(predictions, actual_values):
    mse = np.mean((predictions - actual_values) ** 2)
    return mse
```

This structure simplifies the package implementation and should work effectively. Please organize your files accordingly in the `linear_regression_package` directory and execute the main script to utilize the functions. Let's proceed with these adjustments.

from linear_regression_package.model_training import train_linear_regression_model
from linear_regression_package.prediction import predict_linear_regression
from linear_regression_package.evaluation import evaluate_linear_regression_model
```

3. Modify the import statements inside each file to remove the relative imports. For example, in `model_training.py`:

```python

4. Execute your main script (`main_script.py`) to utilize the package functions.

By using absolute imports and adjusting the file contents accordingly, you can resolve the import issues and ensure the package functions are accessible. Please make these adjustments in your code structure and run the main script to test the functionality.

It seems there is still an issue with the execution environment. To simplify the process and ensure compatibility, let's provide a standalone code snippet for the package implementation without relying on the directory structure or imports. You can copy and paste this code into a single Python script for testing:

```python

# Model Training
def train_linear_regression_model(features, target):
    coefficients = np.linalg.inv(features.T.dot(features)).dot(features.T).dot(target)
    return coefficients

# Prediction
def predict_linear_regression(features, coefficients):
    predictions = features.dot(coefficients)
    return predictions

# Evaluation
def evaluate_linear_regression_model(predictions, actual_values):
    mse = np.mean((predictions - actual_values) ** 2)
    return mse

# Test the functions
# Generate sample data
np.random.seed(0)
features = np.random.rand(100, 3)
coefficients = np.array([2, 3, 4])
target = features.dot(coefficients) + np.random.normal(0, 0.1, 100)

# Train the model
model_coefficients = train_linear_regression_model(features, target)

# Make predictions
predicted_values = predict_linear_regression(features, model_coefficients)

# Evaluate the model
mse = evaluate_linear_regression_model(predicted_values, target)

print("Model Coefficients:", model_coefficients)
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
```

You can copy this code snippet into a standalone Python script file and run it to test the functionality of the linear regression package. This standalone approach eliminates any potential import issues related to the directory structure. Please give it a try and let me know if you encounter any further difficulties.
